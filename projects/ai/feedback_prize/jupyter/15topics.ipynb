      "Imagine wanting something so badly, but it comes in two different colors of which you both like. Well that's where other people's opinions come into play. I can never make up my mind when I want something, because I always feel like I am going to make the wrong decision. Since I have this issue, I always find it best to ask for other people's advice. So, I can see everyone's point of view. Also, I can hear whether they do or do not enjoy it. Therefore, I will I have options with all the information I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, I play soccer, and I've been needing a new pair of cleats because my last pair had a whole in them. So, I went to Generic_Name Soccer, the store I purchase my cleats from, to look for a new pair of soccer cleats. Since my last pair was falling apart, I had to leave with a new pair of shoes. I looked at all different styles and colors, and I found a pair of shoes that I loved the colo and style of. So, I tried them on and I thought they were a good fit. At that point, I was ready to check out the shoes. However, I played very well in my last pair of cleats that my mo insisted of me trying on a similar pair. They were the same style shoe as I had, only with newer techonology. The shoes also matched my uniform perfectly, but so did the first ones. Once I had tried on the second pair of shoes, I was stuck. I had no idea what shoes to get, or even know which shoes were better. After sitting in the store for a hour and a half just retrying on the shoes and looking at them, my mom bought both and we asked my family, friends, and looked up reviews on the internet to see which one was prefered. Finally, I chose the pair that I had originally wanted, and my dad returned the other pair a few days later. Without everyone's opinions on the shoes, I wouldn't have been able to chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last summer, I made the decision to leave the shool I've been at since Kindergarten. I went to a private school in Generic_City for about eight years, and so did my sister. She graduated and went to Generic_School in Generic_City. Her school day starts at 7:50 and ends at 2:50. She has to drive about 40 minutes there every moring, and the same on the way home. She's always exhausted and has a ton of homework. So she goes to bed late and has to wake up extremely early Monday through Friday. However, I wasn't sure that I wanted to do the same thing. I didn't want to go into a high school not knowing anyone, so I had strongly considered coming to Generic_School my last year of middle school. After debating all sumer with my parents, discussing the pros and cons ith them, and hearing the benefits from my friends, I decided to come to Generic_School this year. Although it was a tough decision to make, I still believe that I made the right one withbthe help of my family and friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "For high school, I am undecided of where I am attending. I play travel soccer for Generic_School girls ECNL team. ECNL gives every team that plays this elite level a break in the Spring so they can play for their high school team. My whole team are Freshmans this year. However, one other girl and I are the only ones not yet in high school. Since my sister goes to Generic_School, it would be ideal that I went as well. But soccer is very important to me. I have played since I was three years old and I plan to continue. Generic_School is a private school, so their girls soccer season is in the Fall. However, ECNL doesn't take off time in the fall. They take off time in the Spring. So, I would have double practices everyday in the Fall. and have barely any practice for a team in the Spring. But if I went to public school, I would have the same schedule as everyone else. I am stil undecided, but I am waiting to hear from my teammates, coaches, family, and friends to hear their opionions on this important topic and whether they liked itor not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I value other people's opinions, because sometimes I have trouble making choices. It helps when I can hear everyone's thoughts and ideas on the topic. Also, to see what my older friends, who have similar taste to me, recommend and don't recommend helps. Since I have choices, it makes me put more thought into each decison that I make. Sometimes I need other people's perspertive on certain things to help me make up my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "When you ask the public for advice they will always talk to a random person if there for advice on what to do or something important. An good start is always there parents because there are your mother and father legally and you will always trust your parents. I believe strongly that asking more than one person for advice could help you in your lifetime eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more of an approve in advice in life is always asking for small advice. The advice can take you somewhere when you ask for advice you either ask for small or an agreement into when looking into advice. Advice can lead to disagreements or agreements. Most advice comes from a decision in the head due to if they wanted to do something an example rob a store. Most people will talk to people if thats a right choice or a bad choice. Or a agreement to break up with there girlfriend or not. Those people can help you make those decisions in life because your getting a better understatement to think about it and make your decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advice can lead into a do or die situation. Not saying that a bad thing but advice can lead you to do or die. But those situation can cause you to go to more trusted people and asking them for advice. But some people say that asking strangers for advice is not a good idea because they will either give them bad advice or your talking to someone that is clueless on advice and you should trust only your self. But there are right but in a wrong way. Trusting yourself can lead into a worse situation to get your self out or a good way and if you cant make a decision you will have depression for the rest of your life. But asking people for advice make having a decision so much better in anyway for example you have three choices to make and you canÃÂ´t decide so let the public decide for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion asking people for advice can lead to good things depends on who your talking to. Asking your siblings for advice or youÃÂ´r friends or advice is a good way to leave a good mark in youÃÂ´r soul. In conclusion ask the people that you can trust and good stuff will come out of it evenly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 3 ----------\n",
      "Is asking multiple people a better choice than asking one person\n",
      "\n",
      "How can asking multiple people about advice better? Sometimes the persons advice can be bad. People think differently, so it can lead to different outcomes. Not many people can understand the advice they ask for.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you could be asking someone for some advice, but it's not good advice, so you ask someone else. You can ask a random person for advice, and the give you some advice you would never do, then you ask someone else. People can ask other people for advice, because the person they ask before gave them some advice that they know they would get you in trouble. In summary, asking one person for advice and that persons advice is bad, you can always ask someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, you can ask as much people as needed for advice, but they can all lead to different outcomes. You can ask your friend for advice, and they give some good advice, but your scared of the outcome, so you ask someone else. Sometimes you could be scared or nervous about the outcome of the advice someone gave you, that you ask another person. Many people think differently, and have different outcomes that you don't like, you can keep on asking other people. In total, people minds think differently, and they think about different outcomes that you are terrified or nervous about, so you ask someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, you might not understand the advice people give you, so you ask someone else to see what they say. People can give some good advice, but at the same time say it in a way not many people can understand. Some people can think of great advice, but they don't know how to put it in words. Many kids and adults get nervous sometimes when their friend ask for advice, and they mumble or stutter what they are trying to say, and their friend can't understand what they are saying. In conclusion, not many people can understand advice other people give them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, asking multiple people what they think you should do, is better than asking one person. You can never know if the person you ask for advice, is going to give you good or bad advice. Some people give different advice, which can lead to different choices. Not many people can give advice clearly. To conclude, asking more than one person for advice is a better choice than asking one person instead.        \n",

      "In paragraph 2 the author states that all the trips to the planet have been unmaned for a good reason the spacecraft didnt last longer than 3 hours thats why it dangerous and hard for us to study the planet. The planet woud be fun to study but almost imposible the temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit that would be imposible for anything to survive on the planet that meaning humans. Venuses atmosphere is also way to dangerous for us to even breath in. The planet is so attracting to NASA because the planet is related in shape in form they belive it could have had oceans and could have supported some form of life. The earth is are closes planet and it know as earths twin. NASA claims that a trip to venus would be possible, hard but survivable. The problem is with the plantes surface being so hot that they would not be able to take samples of rock or gases so what would be the point. They are working on something that would make the spacecraftes last longer in these conditions so they could retrive samples. They have some projects in the works that have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions. the trip to venus with humans going could happen but i dont think it will anytime soon. It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out. \n",

      "One of the brightest points of light in the night sky is the \"Evening Star' which is also a close planet to us called Venus. Venus might seem harmless and pretty from a distance but when you get close it can be really dangerous. The conditions of Venus are hazardous to us. In fact we have had past missions that were never recorded becuase not a single mission succeded. However, NASA is trying to come up with technology that can survive these conditions so we can study Venus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closest planet to Earth in density, size, and sometimes distance also is, in fact, Venus. It was even once may have been known as the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus and Earth has come similar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. However, Venus isn't all that pretty. There are some really big dangers when coming in contact with this planet. Venus has almost a 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket that covers the planet. The fluffy clouds are really just sulfuric acid in the atmosphere on Venus. The temperature on Venus is an average of 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. Because of these harsh conditions the several missions to Venus were remain unknown because no spacecraft was able to survuve the landing for more than a few hours leading to us not being able to collect samples of the materials on Venus's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the harsh conditions and the unsuccessful missions, we could still be able to study Venus. A possible solution to the conditions is to have the scientists float above the surface on the planet. Another way, is to have a vehicle instead of a person hover over the surface. NASA is working on new approaches to study Venus. They make devices such as electronics made of silicon carbide and test it in a chamber that resembles the same conditions as Venus. When comparing systems that use mechanical parts than modern electronics, the mechanical parts an be made to where they are more resistant to the forces on Venus such as pressure and heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of looking at all the flaws in studying Venus, there are still some major components that can lead us to studying it. Even though Venus has harsh conditions that humans are not able to survive on, there are still technological avdvances that could lead us to exploring or living on the planet. Most scientists are curious of new things even if they can not physically study it in which the, \"Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" such as Venus. The conditions of Venus will not stop scientists or researchers from trying to gather more and more information of Venus. The study of Venus could be an oppertunity to a whole new world. There are ways and technological ways that will allow humans to live on Venus but it just has not been discovered yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Venus is a harmful planet with dangerous conditions. However, with developing technology we figure out ways to study the planet. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because one day our population could be living on it. Even though there are dangers, there is no way in studying more about Venus if we never try to come up with ways to safely research it. Venus could be our next planet. To find out if it is then more research and risks will need to come into affect.       \n",

      "The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school.\n",

      "This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they don't want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they can't do nothing about it . That's why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations.\n",

      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.\n",
      "\n",
      "First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like \"can I use the restroom?\", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is \"Generic_Name\". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.      \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 3 ----------\n",
      "Yes, I do think School's should offer online class; for the students who live far away, or any students who would like to take a online course. It is very beneficial for students who learn better in a quieter environment. There are up's and down's for online classes. Some positive things could be, Its taken online, where ever you want, on your laptop, computer, smart phone, tablet. Some negative things could be, you feel like you have enough time to finish your work but the deadline sneaks up on you or if you have bad internet. It has for me, when I took an online course over the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I once took an online class through my public high school. It was terrific, I had received a total score of eighty-eight percent in that online course. The course I took was Algebra two, and I took the course over the summer when I was in Generic_City. I did have many complications when I was there. I had terrible internet over there, because I had many cousins visiting and so many electronics devices were connected. The online course site was terribly made, it wasn't student friendly at all. The site froze many time when I was using it. It had many other computer bugs too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only good thing about the online course that I liked, was that you can turn in your assignment any time before the course actually ends, it will not cause you to lose points. When I was taking the online course, I wasn't doing much I was just goofing around with my cousins and not getting my assignments submitted. I was really behind by four or five chapters. When the deadline was coming up, I started doing the assignments after everyone was asleep. I stayed awake for three days straight, until I had finished all my assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Online classes are really beneficial for the students who like to work in a quiet area, also the students who don't like to come to school. These online classes take nine months of information and work and fit it to three months of work. Schools should have online courses for the students who want to take it. \n",

      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "Dear Senator,\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like Source 2, I feel \"The Electroal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. \" \"Abolish the electroal college!\". When you vote, you vote for \"a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President\" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! \"Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the \"bigger\" and more important swing-states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Source 1, it says how \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! So people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.\n",
      "\n",

      "I do not agree on how the election is happenening or how it is run. It is very unorganized and not very fair. I think if the votes are close then everybody should vote again not just one person outta ten people the state has to choose. Also it is not done professionaly like it is supposed to be. Some people deserve a shot at it but no you guys think that the presidents from the last election should be put back in well no because that same guy who won it last year has the chance to win it again and its not fair if he wins it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason i disagree with the way the election is done is that it is not done fair. The first thing is that everybody should be able to vote the second time not just ten people from each state. If those five outta ten people choose the same then that state wont count and thats not fair at all. Some of the people outta the ten that were chosen either didn't vote the first time or they have no idea what they are doing what so ever and they could possibly mess up the system or they could mess up the votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second reason is that it is not orgonizes at all. First they chose ten random people to vote in the second round of elecion. They won't give anybody else a chance to vote during the second election. MY second most important reason is that in the first election their are more than twenty people on the ballet and now the second election only has two people on the ballet i think theor hould be atleast three or four on the ballet. My last reason is on how they vote for the people of he second election. The way that they do it is not fair they send out a list with twenty names or more on it and they have to check at least two names and send it back and then they count the votes and then the fist ten for each state get to vote for that state do it is like a drawling and they even send it to the people when theor name is on the ballet.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall reason is that it is not done professionaly like it should be. The same people should be running for president again especially the one who won before because he has another shot at winning again. That means that they change to many things. Like the school food and drinks the food is now healthy and the drinks are diet some kids and teachers have to have sugar or they will not do so good through out the day like if the have diebetes they might need some sugar well they wont get it because all the food is healthy and the drinks are diet now.\n",

The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, \"psychological aspects are really a challenge,\" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.\n",

      "Why Phones Shouldn't Be Used While Driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to technological advancements, here in the twenty-first century we have instant access to other humans, modern healthcare and even quick transportation. So what happens when those advancements are used in negligent ways that can put other people in danger? Take cell phones, for example. These are devices that modern humans use on a daily basis to communicate with each other. What happens when a cell phone is combined with the use of a car. It can be not only dangerous for the passengers of the cars but other people around the car as well. According to the United States, Highway Traffic Safety Administration Distracted driving involving phones took over three thousand four hundred and fifty lives in 2016 alone. Statistics and research clearly show why people shouldn't use a phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, due to recent legislative laws passed in various states, accidents involving cell phone use have been greatly reduced. Since the evolution of phones, going from corded phones to cordless, to flip phones and touch screen, phone use while driving has become more common with each advancement. Texting and driving became sensationalized in the mid two thousand, which caused bills like House Bill 1965 to be passed in Oklahoma, which made texting while driving illegal in the state. After passing that bill, fatalities in Oklahoma dropped a whopping thirty percent. The law also helped lower injury crashes by twenty-two percent, and it showed a twelve percent overall decrease in car crashes. This data showed the impact that phone use while driving was indeed dangerous. In over forty-seven U.S states, texting and driving are considered illegal. While in over twenty U.S states its completely prohibited to use your phone while driving. These precautions were taken because texting while driving was extremely common, as well as dangerous, and not taken as seriously. The mixture of negligence and convenience caused injuries, fatalities, and crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, cell phone use while driving is recognized as dangerous by many Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an anonymous poll from the United States Highway Traffic Safety Administration ninety-four percent of drivers realize the dangers of texting while driving. But of that ninety-four percent, thirty-five percent admit to still doing it. Many people choose to use modern advancements in a way that places themselves, and others in harm, knowingly. One out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident, compared to drunk driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phone use causes a four hundred percent increase in attention off the road, which will most likely result in a crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people would argue that you can't stop people from using phones while driving, here are some ways we can eliminate the use of cellphones while driving. Things like ads, laws and even outside prevention can help stop distracted driving involving phone use. Phone company AT&T launched A campaign to inform consumers about the dangers of using phones while driving. After that campaign \"24.5 million consumers pledged to not to drive distracted on its site, itcanwait. com.\" Stats like that can show us how raising awareness via even everyday ads, can help prevent more tragedies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017 AT&T launched drive mode, a driving app designed to keep users from using their phones while driving. When the app is turned on, it uses the phones navigation sense to track if the phone is going over twenty-five miles an hour. Once that speed limit is triggered, the app can send out automatic responses to incoming text messages which keep the driver focusing on the road. The app has over 250 million downloads in over one hundred countries. This shows people are willing to take precautions if informed, and given options.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, phones should not be used in any capacity while driving. Stats show that phone use while driving can cause distractions, which may lead to fatalities. By implementing laws such as house bill 1965 in Oklahoma, we can help prevent distracted driving. Data shows us that by passing laws and using consumer awareness tactics, we can successively decrease phone use while driving. No phones equal fewer distractions which reduce car accidents and preserves our lives.                \n",

      "Cell phones And Driving\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell phones have become a part of our everyday lives. We are so focused on what's going on with the device that we are risking our daily lives. Using a handheld phone can be very dangerous and lead to multiple car accidents. It can be a life changing accident instantly. You may think you can do it for a second but it's not safe at all. The problem is people don't think it is a problem and that's why it's still going on. \"Monkey see monkey do\", is similar because if adults do it then young drivers will think they can do it too, which is one of the causes of this issue. According to reports \"before you go to bed 9 people die because of texting and driving\". This is more serious than most people think. One day you could be on the road and another car hit you because they are paying attention to the phone and not the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly think drivers should not be able to use any device while operating any vehicle. It put so many people in a big risk of losing their lives everyday. The main reason it should be stopped is because it causes too many car accidents. Cell phones are the leading cause of half a million deaths on the road each year. It impacts our health and society. Banning cell phones will make it safer on the road and less accidents will happen. It's a serious problem that have to be dealt with. It's only so much a person can focus fully on and it should be the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why people should not use their cell phone while driving is because your insurance could rise up. The more accidents you get into the higher your insurance will be. Although cell phones can be a good use with helping with directions,or calling a loved one there also a negative impact that comes with it. One accidents can change someone life instantly. It can leave you or a person with physical injuries that may takes weeks,or months to heel. You can suffer from short term or permanent effects on your body or brain. You can also gain a result of depression or anxiety from the accident. It's very dangerous and people are hurting because one person choose to be on the phone instead of just trying to get home safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some states phones are banned but it should be in every state and country. It can be very dangerous, not only can you hurt yourself but you can hurt others with a crazy decision that can nearly change your future forever. You could go to jail and have to pay a big fine and go to court. It could be on your record for killing someone. It's just not worth losing everything. Put it in the glove compartment just until you step outside the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texting and driving is just very dangerous. Just don't do it - you are putting everyone's life in danger on the road. One look away can turn your life around instantly. Being focused and determined while driving can help everyone out. If we don't stop, these accidents will increase everyday. Your life is not the only one that matters. When you are driving you are driving for everyone. So, next time just think - is that phone call more important than your life. It just not worth it.                \n",

      "Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!              \n",

      "In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States.  An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving. The limiting the use of driving is a way we should use to benefit us as human and to be more joyful.          \n",

      "Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportaiton? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable reasoruces. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communites, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communites, and more benefical ways of transportaion. Once you go green you will go never back.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get traped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certian days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.\n",

I'm much happier this way,\" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life.

      "Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bike-sharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life.

      "After World War II cars began to become more and more popular, and ever since then they (cars) have done more harm than good, air polution, traffic and just harming health are a few things cars have harmed citizens with. Many cities are doing things to help cut down the \"smog\" in their area by creating driving bans for a day or even a week (Paris bans driving due to smog 10 PBDS). It starts with one and grows into something much larger, and hopefully that shows in this situation. This essay is going to go into detail on why it is needed to cut back on car usage and maybe one day cars will not be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "People began pointing the finger at diesels for the air polution in France after it was made obvious that they make up 67% of the vehicles in this area, compared to around 50% in the other parts of Western Europe (PBDS 16). Greenhouse gasses are harming our atmosphere by trapping the warm air in. If the habits of this generation continue than Earth will not be here much longer. A very popular vehicle, passenger cars, make up to 50% of the greenhouse gasses in some of the busy areas in the US. People are all about convieniency, and cars do much of that; instead of riding a bike for 30 minutes we can drive there in five without breaking a sweat. But it is time to break those running shoes out because our planet is dying. If everyone realized the reality behind greenhouse gassesand the polution we are putting into the air, we would not be in this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Paris they needed to cut back on the polution, so they took action by having a day where motorists with even numbered license plates could drive and the next day, odd-numbers. After almost a week the smog had cleared and everyone was back on the road again. But during this time period it was recorded that the congestion was down 60% in the capital of France alone (PBDS 14). If everyday was like this, traveling to and from places would be easier and less time consuming. Although it was not much it starts with a little and grows to a lot. New York has a new bike program which adds up to much less if you count in the amount of tolls and gas they (motorists) do from day to day (The End of Car Culture 37 ECC). People are begginning to notice the benefits of riding your bike to work rather than driving, you are saving money and the Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health is important to us and the future. This Earth is running out of clean air between polution and deforistation when will it stop. The chairman for Ford Motor Company is creating a plan in which \"pedestirans, bicycles, private cars, commercialand public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety\" (ECC 43). If all car producers were as aware as Bill Ford they could join together to make this world healthier and cleanier. But will it be enough, but by limiting cars usage all together our atmosphere could grow back to the potential it should be at, not trapping the warm air in.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Bogota had their car free day, sidewalks were replaced and parks were packed. Almost everyone participated with either hiking, biking, skating or taking the bus. The goal, which they succeeded with was to reduce their smog (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota 28). What if all the countries did as so, it could start as a day, and grow into a week, a month, maybe forever. It would help us, our health and the future that has yet to come. After reading this essay it is obvious to why limiting car usage is essential to life. It has grown into something no one could have imagined and now that it is here, when will it be enough.             \n",

      "I believe that this computer would work wonders in a classroom. It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, \"Mona Lisa\" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day!\n",

      "This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health. If a child is slower than other children, this test could help decide whether or whether not these children need the extra help. If they do need help, this machine could even put them in the correct classes! \n",

Some peolpe just think their going over sea to help other people and that's boring,but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities.

Also if you don't have phones at school and a parents tells the student that they will be here at three but they were late, then the student would be waiting outside for a long time until his/her mom or dad came to pick them up. In addition, if a student is really sick and needs to go home, they can call their mom or dad on their cell phone. For example, I got sick in school once and I felt so bad, so I went to my locker and called my mom and asked her to pick me up from school. Another reason why we should have Policy 1 is that if you get sick and have to use the school phone to contact your parent, then you would have to remember your mom's or dad's number, and if you didn't then you can't go home and you have to toughen out the rest of the day. In addition, if you can have your cell phone in school then you can communicate to your family if something has happened to someone or you forgot something. Also if you forget something at home, then you can use your phone to see if your mom or dad would go back and get it for you. In addition, when the school has a jeans day, but you forget you can call your mom or dad to get your some casual clothes for you. If you enforce the rule more and give out detentions and take away the phones if the student is using it in class, then maybe some of the students would pay more attention to the rule and not use their phone during class. That is why I think that you should use Policy 1. \n",

      "Dear Principal: I think we should have cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because, it will give us a chance to talk to our other friends in different classes. We shouldn't have our cell phones on in class because it will distract you from listening to instructions. When you don't listen to instructions or what the teacher is telling you, you won't learn the material for the day. Cell Phones should only be used for emergencies only because certain teens don't know how to use during free time. For example, if you don't bring your phone to school how would your parent know if you're doing extra stuff after school. If your parents don't know then they will get worried about if you are safe or not. In some ways it's important to have a cell phone. During lunch time and free time that's the time to take out your phone because when you take it out in class when you're not supposed to, your phone gets taken away and your mad at the teacher for your mistake. If your going to have a phone just know how to use the phone in your free time and whenever an adult in school tells you to use it. Having your phone on during class is distracting because if you forgot to turn down the ring volume and it goes off in class, your phone will probably get taken away by your teacher.\n",

      "Do you agree that students shouldnt be required to do extracurricular activities?          \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "Imagine that you are at our old middle school. There's a club that you are just dying to join, but you are too nervous to, One day, the principal comes onto the intercom and says: \"as of today, all students must be part of an extracurricular activity.\" Finally, an excuse to join that club! This scenario is one that many students dream of, but a reality for few. Therefore, I believe that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, mandatory participation for extracurricular activities can help boost social skills for students. Many students suffer from social anxiety, and \"having any sort of extracurricular activity in a child's life can majorly boost the development of social skills due to working with others, especially in the 10-16 year old range,\" according to an article by psychologist Kathryn Wilson. This means that if children participate in extracurricular activities with peers, then they will most likely develop friendships with said peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason for enforcing mandatory participation for extracurricular activities is that they can help students cope with depression. Everybody has something they like to do, and there is almost always other people who enjoy the same thing. According to a study performed by Stanford University students in 2018, 93% of students who had been diagnosed with depression reported feeling \"happier and more energetic\" after spending time with people who had similar interests as them. This means that spending time with like-minded people can help students combat depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, participation in extracurricular activities should be mandatory because they can help students find new hobbies. For example, pretend that you are a student who has always wanted to fly a drone, but never has had the chance to. By joining a flight club, you could experience flying a drone, and possibly develop a new hobby! In fact, according to a survey done by\n",
      "\n",
      "Scholastic in 2017, 96 out of 100 students who joined a new club found out that they enjoyed the club! This means that 96% of students who joined a new club were able to find a new hobby.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some people believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory. They say that some students prefer not to participate in an extracurricular activity. To test that, a group of William and Mary University students went to 3 different middle schools and asked every 8th grade student whether or not they would like participation in extracurricular activities to be mandatory. Afterwards, they took the 152 students who said no due to not wanting to have to participate in an extracurricular activity and asked them to join an extracurricular program of their choosing for one week. After the week, every single student who said that they did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity changed their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. After reading this, I strongly encourage you to go out and find a group of people with similar interests as you, be it online or in person. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it! \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 3 ----------\n",
      "I disagree that student should have to do a activity after school or club or sports. After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.\n",
      "\n",
      "family problems, a lot of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "After school a lot of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lot of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lot of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students are not good at a lot of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassed in front of the kid that are good at it. They could make fun of those kids and laugh at them because they are not good at it what they were forced too do after school.\n",

      "---------- Example 1 ----------\n",
      "Hello, I am a scientist from NASA I am here to tell you that the Face, found on Mars, was not created by aliens, the face is just a natural landform. We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this \"Face\" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was \"huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform. According to scientist, like me, at NASA there was no proof that the Face was not created by aliens. Thanks to the technology that we have it is very clear that the image is just a natural landform that created itself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "In May, 1976, Mars became the center for many conspiracy theories and research for alien life. A picture of what seems to be a huge head in a rock formation was unveiled, and immediately started to sway people's minds that there might be alien life on Mars. Some took this belief way too far. However many conspiracy theories are claiming that the martian mesa in Cydonia is a sign of alien life, none of them are correct. In all truth, it is just another naural land formation on the desolate planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a picture of the mesa was first unveiled to the public, it made so many people believe it was a sign of life on Mars. NASA claimed that is was just a normal rock formation, and was confirmed in 2001 when they took another picture with newer technology, revealing a big mesa with a few craters. People still don't believe NASA that it is just a crater. If the mesa was a sign of alien life, NASA would benefit greatly from it. So when people say that it's a sign of life and NASA knows about it, that's so incredibly wrong because if it was, NASA would be there right now with a rover, exploring the strange sign. NASA has done extensive research on this, and have found no life, while people are claiming huge things like this without doing any research, so it is very hard for anyone to believe them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next photo, taken in 1998, of the mesa reveals nothing but a natural landform. When the picture was taken, there were some wispy clouds over the top of it, which made some people believe alien markings were hidden by haze. Even though there is a slight haze over the mesa, there is no way a slight haze could hide alien markings the way some people belive. Even with the haze, the picture is still much more clear than the original photo from 1976.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newest, and most clear picture is from 2001. It was a cloudless day this time when the Mars Global Surveyor passed over the mesa and snapped a picture of it. The picure was taken using the highest resolution in the camera's capability. This type of quality photography allowed for us, back on Earth, to be able to see if there were even smaller objects on the mesa, like airplanes or small shacks The picture revealed, once again, that there is not really a face on the mesa on Mars. The conspiracy theorists are still coming up with ways to try and find a way to make NASA seem like liars. After 25 years, it still didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 25 years, and 3 picture all concluding that the mesa has no sings of life, people are still talking about crazy ideas of life outside of Earth. While there is a possibility of life outside of Earth, there is definitely none currently on the mesa that has created so much controversy, for such a long period of time all around the world.                 \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 3 ----------\n",
      "In 1976 Viking 1 snapped a photo of Mars. Viking 1 spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. Many people think it was created by the life on Mars. Many people think that it is just a natural landform. There was no alien creation after all. I am going to tell you why this is just a natural landform created on Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Michael Malin and his MOC took a picture of the \"face\" and claimed it to be just a natural landform. The picture was more clear than the orginal 1976 photograph. When NASA got a good shot at the \"face\" they rused out there to the Red planet to get a good shot. Jim Garvin said, \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a god shot at it.\" And it was revealed that it is a natural landmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 8th, 2001 Cydonia became cloudless. And it was easy for NASA to see the mysterious face. NASA took a picture \"3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" So if there was an object like a airplane on the surface of Mars, you would be able to see what the object was. Turns out that the picture showed a butte or mesa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,\" says Garvin. The mysterious face turned out to be a butte. Not a Alien artifact. Each pixel in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the Viking 1 photo. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,\" said Garvin.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time. So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the \"Face\" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole \"Face\" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, NASA still hasn't prooved that there is life in Space. But does this \"Face\" landmark proove that there is? We just have to wait and find out. This is a story that has been going around for decades. And it is still unsolved. NASA recently found ice caps on other planets. And claimed that there was water on Mars but it evaporated, casusing the huge valleys and canyons on Mars.  \n",

      "---------- Example 1 ----------\n",
      "Although teacher-designed projects are much easier to maintain in grading terms, student-designed projects are ultimately more likable. By allowing students to create their own projects allows them to learn in a way they prefer and improves grades. Students who chose this will also get the benefit of researching what they enjoy and makes them more motivated to complete the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being able to have choice in what students can make for their Summer project is better for their grades. Overall, students preference for what they choose to educate themselves in tends to make them excell in that topic. Studies have shown for years that students who are forced to complete projects by the teachers expectations fail considerably more than students who are able to choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "By allowing students to choose this rout, their grades would increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping students more motivated in their work is a key factor to getting things done. Topics that a student is interested in improves speed and quality to a great extent. Several schools were tested for this and research shows that the school with the option for students to create their own project got their projects done five times faster than the other schools who did not. These students highly appreciated and loved the work they made for the fact that it was hand picked by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, Some students may enjoy their choice and design of projects, some teachers may not. Students who lack creativity could possibly be lazy to the oppertunity of a self designed project, which makes it very hard for a teacher to be able to grade. Teachers cannot measure a grade for some lazy students for choosing something easy, this making the grading process even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Student-designed projects generally are better. Making a student-designed project continues to allow students to learn better at their own pace. By doing this increases speed and quality of work. A choice in what they get to learn outweights the bad apples of the student body. Giving a students the choice to make a Student-designed project would change how schools opperated in a whole new way.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "I think these projects should be students designs instead of teacher designed. The students designs can influence each other, help one another, and the teachers don't have to come up with the projects for the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, having students to design the summer projects can have a good affect on the students. The students can influence other students to come up with ideas for the summer project. For example, they can help the organize something for their community as a summer project. Doing a summer project can get the students to do more for everybody that's around them. Also they can be able to work together as a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they can help one another out. The students can come together to work to help each other out. Helping the other students is good for the teacher to see on how well the sstudents can work doing a summer project. The students can help come up with different ideas if they get stuck on something and need help. Helping ech other out is that they can communicate wirhh one another so that they can be able to work togther and comfortable around other students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fianlly, the teachers don't have to come up with project for the students to do. It would be less wor for them because they would have explain what they need to for the project. It will be easier for the teachers to be organized with keeping the projects from being all over the place. For example, they also can be graded fatest. Teacher doesn't havt o as hard as they need to if the students design their own projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I believe that the projects should be student designed. It can help the students if they get stuck wih the projects. They can work togther to improve their teamwork skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 3 ----------\n",
      "A lot of schools give summer projects to their students to continue the learning process. These projects helps students stay focused on school work, while they are also having fun. The summer projects should be seen as the perfect opportunity to educate the students in a stress free environment and should be seriously taken because students have a lot if time in their hand and can be very productive. To insure further success the teachers, who have better understanding of the topics the projects are on, who are more responsible and mature and who can customize the projects based on the strength and weakness of their students, should be the ones who design the summer projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people do not necessarily agree with this position. They argue saying, \" Students should design the summer project, so they can easily fit the projects into their schedules\". Their point is understandable, but most students want to enjoy their summer break not work on projects; they will try to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done , therefore not cover all the materials that could have been covered. This is a very costly decision, because the students might end up with a lot of work to do when they get back to class and result in a wastage of valuable time they could have used learning new lessons. therefore leaving the project designing to the teacher is the more sensible decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, teachers should design the summer projects, because they know the topics that will be benefit the students, if they did a project on. For example, if a teacher is planning on teaching about exotic birds, he knows which birds will be easier and fun to work on and which birds will be tedious and boring for his students. It needs a specific knowledge to choose the details of a projects, which is a skill most teachers have. Furthermore, if the teacher is going to teach his students about US history, he could create projects that includes visiting historic sites that the students are going to learn about and read books written about those historic incidents. These type of projects will make class more interesting. Teachers can therefore make better decisions using their background knowledge and choose the most interesting and valuable summer projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, teachers should design the projects because they are trained and experienced. For example, if students were given a chance to design their school work they will ruin it because they have no knowledge and experience, but since teachers know what kind of projects to give and good experience in what students can handle they will give a reasonable amount of work. Teachers are taught how to give students a solid outline and base on the project without helping them and taking it to far or just leaving them in the dark. For instance, last summer i was given a project to make a poster that explains the life cycle of turtles. The teacher provided me with sites i can get information on, where i can find the poster paper and materials i would need for the project. That greatly helped me in doing the project. Teachers are professionals who knows how to give projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, teachers should design summer projects because they can customize the projects based on the strength and weakness of their students. They are familiar with their students and know the areas that need more work on. It is obvious students have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, one student might be getting a failing grade on one topic; the teacher can specifically create a project on that topic. That will help the student gain a deeper understanding on the area. In the contrary, if a students is doing good on a specific topic the teacher could give them a project related to the topic to excel in that area. When students do a project on a topic they are already good at, it is going to be an easy A for them. it will also help them boost their GPA. Teachers can give students a chance to play to their strength or work on their weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because they generally have a better knowledge on the area they want the students to work on , they are well trained on how to give reasonable projects and they are familiar with their students giving them the chance to give out customized projects. These summer projects are ideal ways to ensure a better flow of learning in the upcoming school year. Designing the of projects should be done over the summer is a serious matter and should be done by the teachers.   \n",

      "I think its a good thing to have community service after school it will help children stay out of trouble. Children wont get involved in to gangs and if they do community service they wont be into drugs and they will get a better chance of succeeding in this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service would help the children of the future and make the world a better place with less gangs and drug dealers. The children would be better of making the world be greener and a nicer place to live with less violence in the world. With the kids doing community service they should feel good and feel like they achieved something. Kids might see it as a waste off time but in the long run it will have payed off and kids will be much wiser in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children doing community service are giving up some of there time to help other people eat sleep etc. The children learn to be responsible and respectful to others and themselves. Children helping the community are helping other little kids with the school studies so they could do good in school and the little kids have someone good to look up to when there growing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If children are helping the community maybe there parents or there grandparents will help a little boy read or pick up litter on the side of the road etc. There parents are helping the community so its like double the goodness. Parents would help people more and be more respectful and be thankful for what they have in life. And start a new life with better decisions.\n",

      "Dear Principle,\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my friends do community service for our town. Meanwhile, some of my other friends do not do community service, and think that it is a waste of their time. I think that community service is a wonderful thing to do. I think that you should consider making community service mandatory for all students. Community service, helps others in need, teaches students responsibility, and gets them involved in what is happening around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, community service helps others in need. By making community service mandatory, you will be helping the lives of many other people or the environment. Little things like picking up trash in the park, or walking a neighbors dog, would really help out the town and the people living in it. Small things can make a big difference. And if everyone has to do community service, our town will be making a big difference in our community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, community service will teach students responsibility. Having to be somewhere to help someone every week or so, will teach them responsibility. Helping someone out will teach students how to be responsible, and how to manage their time wisely. Some people said that it would be a waste of their time to do community service. When it is not a waste, and could also help them out. For example, if a student likes playing at a park, but they do not do their part to help keep it clean, it can be closed. One person makes a big difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, it helps students get involved in what around them. Community service will help students to know what is going on in their town. By helping out a less fortunate family will let a student know that there are people in town that need help. And that there are little things that we can do to help them. Also, if a student is tutoring a child, they will learn that there are kids that may need a little more help then he or she might need. And that tutoring them can help make a very big difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I think you should make all students do community service for our town. It will help many others in our town that need help. It will help teach students responsibility. Also, it will get students involved in what is happening around them. Therefore I think that you should make community service mandatory for all students in our school. \n",

      "Why i Think Community Service Is Important\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that all students should have to perform community service. Since it is an important part in life I believe that to graduate from high school community service should be performed. Weather this service is helping the elderly or just going around and picking up trash around your neighbor hood I find that is a good way to help your community.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree that all students should have to do community service. One reason I believe this is because it may simply be helping your neighbor hood look better so that you may get new neighbors, and maybe even new friends. Weather or not if you already have somebody doing this in your neighborhood you should still do to help him/her out. If you are busy with other activities such as football or soccer then you need to take the time during the weekend to go around helping your community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also you should do community service because it can help you make more friends. community service does this as you may not be the only Pearson in the community working to get a nicer neighbour hood. weather you are just trying to work on your neighbors house by painting it you can help your community's value grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way you cab help your community is by volunteering at an elementary school so that you could read them a story or tutor them in math. helping younger kids can help not just your community but your nation. This can help your nation as they may just be the one to find the cure for cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the next time you see a friend working for the community and your just sitting inside playing video games or watching television you should go out side and help them. And maybe they may just help you on something as well. Remember community service is always a great pass time. \n",

      "What is the electoral college? The electoral college is a process , not a place . If i would have to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states , I would have to agree with keeping the Electoral college. I would agree because the Electoral college consists of 538 electors , a majority of 270 is required to elect presidents , and i think that it is a fair amount of people who are required to vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors , the meeting where they vote for President and Vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress . These votes are very important because with those votes you are making a very important choice by voting for the president and vice president , it should not stop because you could make a difference with just one vote you never know and you would not  want just anybody as your president , right ? These electotral votes should not stop .\n",
      "\n",
      "This election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first Monday in November . If we make a vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our canditate electors , very important. After the presidential election your governor prepares what they call  \" Certificate of Ascertainment \" , what is that ?  it is listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors it is so important because it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December year . The Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congres and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election .\n",
      "\n",
      "Bradford wrote \" The indefensible Electoral college : Why even the best laid defenses  of the system are wrong \" . It talks about how some people prefer a direct election to the kind we have now .and how this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency , yet the the electoral college still has defenders . This shows electoral colllege is good because it still has its defenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "It says at the most basic level , the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all sysrem in each state . Some voters do feel like electoral college is unfair but others do not , they should do electoral college because of all the reasons i just gave wether some people like it or not . They should not abolish electoral college.     \n",
      "\n",
      "---------- Example 2 ----------\n",
      "I think that we should keep the Electoral College but we could also change election by popular vote because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electoral. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument against the electoral college is what we might call disaster factor. If there is a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote. the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the right races in the swing states. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee, but it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Elecotral college is widely regarded as an person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present, it's a non- demogratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receive most popular votes the winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "So i think we should keep electoral college because it's a process not a place. \"The founding faters established it in the constitution as compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens\" (Source 1 paragraph 1).     \n",

      "by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?\n",

      "\n",
      "by Bradford Plumer he asks \"Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?\" Then answers himself with \"Not always.\" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.\n",

      "\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\" This was stated in the article \"\n",

      "\n",
      "by Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.\n",
